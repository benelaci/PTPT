# Description

If you use a password manager and hate entering its password every few hours, spend some minutes with this tool now and then. The typing speed will improve in a relatively fun way, and the pain of unlocking the password manager will ease each time. I've done some practing, and now I'm in an ‘oh my god, this is f\*ckin amazing’ state when it comes to it.

The speed of each entry is measured, and correct entries are distinguished from false ones.

# Installation

1. **Click** [`HERE`](https://github.com/benelaci/PTPT/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) to download all files in zip.
2. Put the zip content into the desired folder.
3. Open `ptpt.html` in a browser.

(The app is plain html/javascript, so no web server is needed.)

# Things to know

- The ✅ marks indicate the passwords that were entered correctly. You can set the correct password by clicking the empty square.
- You can erase the input by pressing ESC
- You cannot copy from the screen because pressing a key focuses the input

# Assurance

This tool is safe. It runs on your local computer, does not store passwords in any form, does not communicate online, and the source code is disclosed and human readable.
