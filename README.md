# Description

If you use a password manager and hate entering its password every few hours, spend a couple of minutes with this tool now and then. The typing speed will improve in a relatively fun way, and the pain of unlocking the password manager will relieve every time.

The speed of each entry is measured, and correct entries are distinguished from false ones.
